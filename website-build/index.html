        <div class="text-image-box">
          <img src="./images/military-personnel-high-tech-control-center-process-critical-information.jpg">
          <h3 style="color: #000000;">Investing & Donating</h3>
          <p>When you buy VMF Coin, you get two benefits: you receive your VMF 
          Coin purchase, and you can choose a charity to receive an equal 
          amount in real money (USDC). The best part? You only pay for your 
          VMF Coin purchase - the donation to the charity comes from VMF Coin's 
          circulation at no extra cost to you. For example, if you buy $10 worth of VMF Coin, 
          you can choose a veteran support charity to receive $10 in real money, and you only 
          pay that $10 total.<br><br>
          <h3 style="color: #000000;">Rewards & Incentives</h3>
          <p>Our platform rewards everyone involved while supporting veterans. When you buy VMF 
          Coin, you can earn 5% interest by holding onto it, plus get to vote on which veteran 
          charities receive donations. As an ambassador, you'll also receive special holiday 
          rewards for helping spread the word. Every transaction automatically adds pennies to 
          our community charity pool, and all VMF Coin holders get to vote on which veteran 
          support charities receive that money. Meanwhile, veteran support charities receive real 
          money donations through our USDC program, all at no cost to them. It's a win-win system 
          where everyone benefits while supporting our heroes.<br>
        <br><h3 style="color: #000000;">Community Voting System</h3><br>
        Every VMF Coin holder gets a voice in supporting our veteran community through our voting 
        system. Here's how it works: when you own VMF Coin, you get to vote on which veteran support 
        charities receive money from our community pool. The pool grows automatically from pennies 
        collected during transactions, and we release these funds to the chosen charities on special 
        military observance days like Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and Independence Day. This way, the 
        VMF community directly decides which organizations receive support, ensuring that donations go 
        to the causes that matter most to our holders while honoring our nation's heroes on meaningful 
        dates.<br>
        <br><h3 style="color: #000000;">Store of Value for Your Investment</h3><br>
        VMF Coin serves as a strong store of value for both investors and veteran charities. For 
        investors, it offers a unique combination of benefits: you can earn 5% interest by holding your 
        coins, participate in voting for veteran charities, and receive special holiday rewards as an 
        ambassador. For veteran charities, VMF Coin provides a stable source of funding through our 
        automatic donation system, with guaranteed releases of funds on military observance days. This 
        creates a sustainable ecosystem where value grows through community support and charitable giving, 
        benefiting both investors and the veteran community while maintaining stability through our unique 
        reward structure.</p>

        <h3 class="right">Why Are We Doing This?</h3>
        <p>We created VMF Coin because we believe our veterans deserve more than just gratitude - they deserve 
          real support and resources. That's why we're building a unique cryptocurrency platform that helps 
          veterans through automatic donations while rewarding those who support this mission. Every transaction 
          adds to our community charity pool, and holders get to vote on which veteran organizations receive these 
          funds. We're providing this entire platform free to veteran charities, ensuring they receive 100% of all 
          donations. While we're starting with veteran support, we believe this model can help charitable causes 
          worldwide, creating a sustainable ecosystem where everyone benefits while supporting those who need it 
          the most.</p>

        <h3 class="right">How To Be Part of the VMF Community</h3>
        <p>
          VMF Coin is a platform that's open to everyone, from individual investors to charitable organizations. 
          While our main focus is on supporting veteran charities through automatic donations and community voting, 
          anyone can join and help make a difference. Whether you're a veteran, a supporter of veteran causes, or simply 
          someone who believes in using cryptocurrency for good, you're invited to be part of our community. As a member, 
          you'll earn 5% interest on your holdings and get to vote on which veteran charities receive our community pool 
          donations. You can also become an Ambassador by helping spread the word about how VMF Coin supports veterans and 
          inviting other charitable organizations to join our mission, earning special holiday rewards and recognition for 
          your role in helping us build a community that makes a real difference in veterans' lives.</p>

        <h3 class="right">What Is The Future For VMF Coin</h3>
        <p>
          As VMF Coin grows, we envision a future where cryptocurrency technology transforms charitable giving worldwide. 
          While we're starting with supporting our veterans, our platform model can be adapted to help all types of charitable 
          causes. Imagine a world where every cryptocurrency transaction automatically supports good causes, where donors have 
          direct control over where their money goes, and where charities receive 100% of donations without any fees. This 
          isn't just a dream - it's what we're building with VMF Coin. As our community grows, we'll expand our impact beyond 
          veteran support to help other charitable sectors, creating a global network of cryptocurrency users who are making a 
          difference with every transaction. The potential is enormous: we could help feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, support 
          medical research, and protect our environment, all while maintaining transparency and community control. Our goal is to 
          create a new standard for charitable giving in the cryptocurrency space, where technology serves humanity and everyone 
          has the power to make a positive impact.</p>
