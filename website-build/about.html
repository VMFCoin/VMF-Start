            <img src="images/about-section-two.jpeg">
            <p> VMF Coin shatters the boundaries of traditional organizations - we're not a company or corporation, we're a revolutionary 
                force for change, a living, breathing community of purpose-driven individuals united by blockchain technology and a shared 
                mission to transform how we support our nation's heroes. We're a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which means we're 
                a community of people working together, governed by rules programmed into our blockchain, not by a boardroom. We're everyone 
                who holds our coin, everyone who donates, and everyone who votes - we're all VMF Coin.<br>
                <br>VMF Coin is a groundbreaking cryptocurrency platform that's revolutionizing how we support veterans and military families. 
                Built on blockchain technology, our platform combines innovative charitable giving mechanisms with community-driven decision 
                making to create a transparent and efficient way to make a difference.</p>

        <div class="section-three section-img-text-wrap-left">
            
            <p>Our mission is deeply personal. As a team with veterans in our own families, we've witnessed firsthand the sacrifices made by those 
               who serve. We've seen the impact of their service on our loved ones and our nation. That's why we're dedicated to creating a better 
               way to support those who have given so much to protect our freedom and way of life.<br>
            <img src="images/about-section-three2.jpeg"><br>
               Our platform is built as a tribute to the brave men and women who have served the United States of America. We believe that their 
               sacrifices deserve more than just gratitude - they deserve action. That's why we've created a system where every transaction contributes 
               to supporting veterans and military families, and where the community has a direct say in how funds are distributed.</p>
            <p>Through our unique combination of blockchain technology and community governance, we're creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that benefits
                 both donors and recipients. Our platform ensures that donations reach their intended purpose quickly and efficiently, while maintaining
                  the highest standards of transparency and accountability.
                We're committed to making a meaningful difference in the lives of veterans and military families, and we invite you to join us in this mission. 
                Whether you're a donor looking to make an impact, a charity seeking support, a crypto enthusiast interested in blockchain innovation, or simply 
                someone who believes in our cause, we welcome you to be part of our community.
